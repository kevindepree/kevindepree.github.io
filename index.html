        <h2>Kevin Daniel DePree</h2>
        <h3>Bio</h3>
        <p>At 8 years old, Kevin DePree started drumming on a junior drum set purchased from a flea market. During the years that followed, DePree’s interest in drumming developed into a passion for music which has driven him to become the multifaceted artist he is today. In the beginning of his career, he performed as a full time drummer in touring acts throughout the United States and Europe. He gained the majority of his music knowledge on the band stage, performing styles from EDM to Jazz.</p>
        <p>DePree got his start in television and film as an assistant for London based composer Sheridan Tongue. While contributing to several BBC 1 crime dramas as a studio musician, DePree was able to learn the art of film music with a “hands on” approach. DePree’s training and experience continued while co-writing alongside Tongue on several of his EMI Production Music albums as a programmer, sound designer, and composer. Fueled by a passion for composing for television and film, DePree chose to branch out on his own, producing large amounts of works for various music libraries and indie films. To date, DePree’s music has appeared on ABC, A&E, Animal Planet, BBC 1, BBC 2, BBC 5, Discovery Channel, FOX Sports, History Channel, MSNBC, NFL Network, PBS, RTE, Sky Sports, UFC, Velocity, and other film and TV shows internationally.</p>
